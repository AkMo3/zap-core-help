<h1>Active Scan tab</h1>

The Active Scan tab allows you to perform an <a href="../../start/concepts/ascan.html">active scan</a>
on any of the sites that have been accessed.<br> 
<br>
Sites can be selected via the toolbar or the <a href="sites.html">Sites tab</a>.<br>
Any sites that have have been are are currently being scanned are marked in bold in the toolbar Sites pulldown control.<br>
The toolbar provides a set of buttons which allow you to start, stop, pause and resume the scan selected.<br>
A progress bar shows how far the scan of the selected site has progressed.<br>
The 'Current scans' value shows how many scans are currently active - 
hovering over this value will show a list of the sites being scanned in a popup. 

<h2>Right click menu</h2>
Right clicking on a node will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

<h3>Exclude from</h3>
This menu has the following submenus:

<h4>Proxy</h4>
This will exclude the selected nodes from the proxy. They will still be proxied via ZAP but will not be shown 
in any of the tabs.<br/>
This can be used to ignore URLs that you know are not relevant to the system you are currently testing.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog   

<h4>Scanner</h4>
This will prevent the selected nodes from being actively scanned.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog   

<h4>Spider</h4>
This will prevent the selected nodes from being spidered.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog   

<h3>إعادة إرسال...</h3>

<a href="../dialogs/resend.html">Resend dialog</a> which allows you to  
resend the request after making any changes to it that you want to.

<h3>New Alert...</h3>

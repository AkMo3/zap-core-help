The Sites tab shows all of the URLs visited in a tree structure. <br/>
You can select any of the nodes in the tree to display the request and response for that URL 
in the relevant tabs.<br/>
</p>

<h2>Desni klik meni</h2>

<h3>Napad</h3>
Napad meni ima sljedeće podmenije:

<h4>Active Scan...</h4>
This will launch the <a href="../dialogs/advascan.html">Aktivno Skeniranje</a> dialog which allows you to initiate an 
<a href="../../start/concepts/ascan.html">aktivni sken</a> with the starting point set to the request you selected.<br/>

This will launch the <a href="../dialogs/spider.html">Pauk</a> dialog which allows you to initiate the 
<a href="../../start/concepts/spider.html">pauk</a> with the starting point set to the request you selected.<br/>

<h3>Include in Context</h3>
This menu allows you to include the selected nodes and all of their subordinates in the specified
<a href="../../start/concepts/contexts.html">context</a>.<br/>
You also have the option to create a new context.<br/>
The <a href="../dialogs/session/contexts.html">Sesijski Konteksti</a> dialog will be displayed to
allow you to make any additional changes.

<h3>Exclude from Context</h3>
This menu allows you to exclude the selected nodes and all of their subordinates from the specified
<a href="../../start/concepts/contexts.html">context</a>.<br/>
The <a href="../dialogs/session/contexts.html">Sesijski Konteksti</a> dialog will be displayed to
allow you to make any additional changes.

<h3>Flag as context</h3>
This menu has the following submenus for each of the 
<a href="../../start/concepts/contexts.html">contexts</a> you have defined:

<h4>Login request</h4>
This identifies the specified node as a login request.<br/>
You may only have one node identified as such in any one context.<br/> 
The <a href="../dialogs/session/contexts.html">Sesijski Konteksti</a> dialog will be displayed to
allow you to make any additional changes.

You may only have one node identified as such in any one context.<br/> 
The <a href="../dialogs/session/contexts.html">Sesijski Konteksti</a> dialog will be displayed to

<h3>Isključi iz</h3>
This menu has the following submenus:

<h4>Proxy</h4>
This will exclude the selected nodes from the proxy. They will still be proxied via ZAP but will not be shown 
in any of the tabs.<br/>
This can be used to ignore URLs that you know are not relevant to the system you are currently testing.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Svojstva Sesije</a> dialog   

<h4>Skener</h4>
This will prevent the selected nodes from being actively scanned.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Svojstva Sesije</a> dialog   

<h4>Pauk</h4>
This will prevent the selected nodes from being spidered.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Svojstva Sesije</a> dialog   

<h3>Obriši</h3>
This will remove the node and all of its children from ZAP.<br/>
However they can be added back in, to prevent this use the 'Exclude from' menus. 

<h3>Prekid...</h3>
This will bring up a new window which will allow you to set a 
<a href="../../start/concepts/breakpoints.html">tačka prekida</a> on that URL.<br/>
The break point is defined via a regular expression. If you visit a URL which matches this 
expression then ZAP will intercept it and allow you to change either the request and/or the
response.

<h3>Upozorenja za ovaj nod</h3>
If the URL selected has <a href="../../start/concepts/alerts.html">upozorenja</a> associated with it then 
they will be listed under this menu.<br>
Selecting one of the alerts will cause it to be displayed.

<h3>Ponovno...</h3>
This will bring up the
<a href="../dialogs/resend.html">Ponovno slanje dijalog</a> which allows you to  
resend the request after making any changes to it that you want to.

<h3>Novo Upozorenje...</h3>
This will bring up the
<a href="../dialogs/addalert.html">Dodaj Upozorenje dijalog</a> which allows you to manually record a new  
<a href="../../start/concepts/alerts.html">alert</a> against this request.

<h3>Prikaži u Histori tabu</h3>
This will show the selected node in the <a href="history.html">Historija tab</a>.

<h3>Otvori URL u Pretraživaču</h3>
This will open the URL of the selected node in your default browser.

<h3>Generate anti CSRF test form</h3>
This will open a URL which will give you a generated form for testing for CSRF issues.<br>
It will only be enabled for POST requests, if the API is enabled and if Java supports the opening of URLs 
in a browser on your platform. 

<h3>Osvježava stablo Sajtova</h3>
Occasionally the Sites tree can be displayed incorrectly - this option will redraw it.

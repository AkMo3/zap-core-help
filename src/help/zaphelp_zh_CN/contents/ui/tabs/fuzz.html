<h1>Fuzzer tab</h1>

The Fuzzer tab shows you the requests and responses performed when you <a href="../../start/concepts/fuzz.html">fuzz</a>
a string.<br>
Selecting a row see the full requests and responses.
You can also search for strings in the fuzz results using the <a href="search.html">Search tab</a>. 
<br>
	<h2>HTTP Fuzzer results</h2>
	The results have to be manually assessed to know if any vulnerability was found.
	<br> Meaning of values of the "State" column:
	<ul>
		<li>"Successful" - the message was successfully sent/received;</li>
		<li>"Error" - an error occurred while creating or sending/receiving the message
			(for example: malformed HTTP message, time out while reading the response);</li>
		<li>"Reflected" - the injected fuzz string (value of "Fuzz" column) was found in
			the response body.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Right click menu</h2>
Right clicking on a row will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

<h3>Exclude from</h3>
This menu has the following submenus:

<h4>Proxy</h4>
This will exclude the selected nodes from the proxy. They will still be proxied via ZAP but will not be shown

The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog   

<h4>Scanner</h4>
This will prevent the selected nodes from being actively scanned.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog   

<h4>Spider</h4>

resend the request after making any changes to it that you want to.
